# Powershell Baseline Script
This is a work in progress. The goal is to create a script that will take a snapshot of interesting data (processes, services, etc) of a machine and have the ability to do a comparison of the snapshot in the future. 

This script will create a folder with the computer name in it. Additionally, each of the search results will be saved to a text file. 

It is built to run with version 2 (I have an updated one for versions 4 and above)
